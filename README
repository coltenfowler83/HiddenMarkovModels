This project contains bigram and trigram POS taggers using Hidden Markov Models.

Bigram_main.py and Trigram_main.py are both runnable.

Each script creates the HMM tagger, then runs the tagger for each sequence in twt.dev.json and twt.test.json.

The scripts output the accuracy value of the tagger vs the observed values dev and test data.
